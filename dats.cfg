[general]
; Which packet sizes to use when testing. Tests are run for each
; packet size in turn.
; Default value: 64,128,256,512,1024,1280,1518
pkt_sizes=64

; Total number of ports to test
; Default value: 4
;number_of_ports=4
number_of_ports=2

; Which tests to run. This can be overridden by specifying test names
; on the command line.
; Default value: all tests in the tests/ directory.
tests=001_port_fwd

; This setting specifies the percentage of packets sent by the Tester that can
; be tolerated to be lost, instead of being properly forwarded by the SUT.
; Note: Although the % symbol must not be provided here, the supplied value is a
; percentage: a value of 0.001 means 0.001%, that is 1 packet is tolerated to be
; lost out of 100,000 packets sent by the Tester to the SUT.
; Default value: 0.0
tolerated_loss = 0.001
