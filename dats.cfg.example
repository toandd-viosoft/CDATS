[general]
; Which packet sizes to use when testing. Tests are run for each
; packet size in turn.
; Default value: 64,128,256,512,1024,1280,1518
;pkt_sizes=64,128,256,512,1024,1280,1518

; Total number of ports to test
; Default value: 4
;number_of_ports=4
number_of_ports=2

; Which tests to run. This can be overridden by specifying test names
; on the command line.
; Default value: all tests in the tests/ directory.
;tests=01_port_fwd,101_bng

; This setting specifies the percentage of packets sent by the Tester that can
; be tolerated to be lost, instead of being properly forwarded by the SUT.
; Note: Although the % symbol must not be provided here, the supplied value is a
; percentage: a value of 0.001 means 0.001%, that is 1 packet is tolerated to be
; lost out of 100,000 packets sent by the Tester to the SUT.
; Default value: 0.0
;tolerated_loss = 0.001

; Duration (in seconds) for each trial of the test
; When test is running it will remain stable for this duration
; before stopping and analyzing the recieved traffic
; Default value: 5.0
;test_duration = 60.0

; Pecision of the measured throughput in percentage of line-rate
; The binary search algorithm stops when the difference between
; the min and max bounds are less then this value
; Default value: 1.0
;test_precision = 0.1

[logging]
; Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.
level=INFO

; Default value: dats.log
;file=dats.log

; See https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter for an
; explanation on the log format and datefmt and
; https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes for a list
; of format attributes.
